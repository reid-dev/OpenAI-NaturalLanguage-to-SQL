# OpenAI-NaturalLanguage-to-SQL

A simple proof of concept that allows a non-programmer to write a program in natural language and have it converted to SQL Code.
## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Sign up for an account on OpenAI.com/API and create an API key
3. Create your own .env file by renaming the .env.example to .env and put your api key within it
4. Install the needed requirements:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Either load up the Jupyter Notebook and run through it or run the python file directly:
    - cd python_files
    - python main.py


### To-Do

Create a Flask application with an HTML form to allow users to input their own natural language code and have it converted to SQL code.
